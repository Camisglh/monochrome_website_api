This is a demo version of the API of my future site for my games in monochrome style. 
To run, you need to create an `.env` file and write a password and database there. The password is used for the operations of creating deletion and update. The application uses postgresql
```
CRUD_PASSWORD = 'password'

DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db'
```
